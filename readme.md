# RC2400 Dev Board

Development board for the **Crafts RC2400** IEEE 802.15.4 standard radio module. So zigbee is also supported.

I created this dev board because I couldn't find any existing development boards for the RC2400 module. The PCB is designed as a **one-sided board** to keep fabrication simple and accessible.

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**
> This project is not finished yet — schematics, layout, and documentation may change as I continue development.

## Features (Planned)

- One-sided PCB for easy DIY fabrication
- Breakout of all RC2400 pins
- No power regulators 
- Changable UART/SPI  interface
- Antenna connector footprint
- I have maybe should have made universal breakout for the AN026 footprint

## Status

- [x] PCB fabricated and assembled
- [ ] Testing ongoing
- [ ] Documentation in progress
