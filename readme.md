# RC2400 Dev Board

Development board for [AN026](https://radiocrafts.com/uploads/AN026_One_Common_Footprint_For_Many_Technologies.pdf). Which is a footprint for Radio Crafts modules.

I created this dev board because I couldn't find any existing development boards for the RC2400 module.  
I believe the community should benefit from my work, which is why I made it universal (AN026) and single-sided.  

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**

## Features

- PCB antenna. *The traces aren't tuned*
- All pins broken out.
- Its compatible with older modules which doesnt have the newer numbering.
